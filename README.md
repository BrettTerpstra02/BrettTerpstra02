### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br>
<br>
I am primarily a Java developer, but I sometimes use Python and shell for Linux scripts. You'll find plenty of random project I've started. Some of them for school, others just to pass the time. Iâ€™m currently slowly learning C but I am mostly focusing on school, which is Java. <br>
