# Hello
Check out some of my repos or [website](https://tpgc.me/).
Note: some repos might only be available on my self-hosted git server [here](https://git.tpgc.me)

## Pinned Repositories
### BLT
- C++ utility library containing reusable modules. Includes features such as configurable logging with colored output, command line argument parsing with syntax similar to Python, and much more!
### OpenGL Documentation Generator
- Ever notice how C/C++ OpenGL libraries don't have inline documentation for the OpenGL functions? I missed this from LWJGL so this project will automatically add CLion-compatible, Javadoc style comments to any OpenGL bindings library.
### Trapdoor Engine
- Game Engine started in Java which was made for second-year res friends. Partially ported to C++
### TotalCrafter
- Grade 12 Java Minecraft Clone
### Scripts
- Useful scripts and files
