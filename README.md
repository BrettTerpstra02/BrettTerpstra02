<br>
I am a Co-Op computer science student at Brock University. I usually use Java, but I sometimes use Python for quick scripts. Most of the projects on my Github are unimportant, however, some projects such as [TotalCrafter](https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/TotalCrafter), [Legacy-3D-Visual-Basic](https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/Legacy-3D-Visual-Basic), and [ProcessingProject](https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/ProcessingProject) were made for school. Other projects like [Ludum-Dare-46](https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/Ludum-Dare-46) were made for compitations. <br>
For legal reasons, my Brock projects will not be uploaded. <br>
