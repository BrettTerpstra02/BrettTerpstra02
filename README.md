<br>
I am a Co-Op computer science student at Brock University. I usually use Java, but I sometimes use Python for quick scripts. Most of the projects on my Github are unimportant, however, some projects such as <a href="https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/TotalCrafter">TotalCrafter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/Legacy-3D-Visual-Basic">Legacy-3D-Visual-Basic</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/ProcessingProject">ProcessingProject</a> were made for school. Other projects like <a href="https://github.com/BrettTerpstra02/Ludum-Dare-46">Ludum-Dare-46</a> were made for compitations. <br>
For legal reasons, my Brock projects will not be uploaded. <br>
